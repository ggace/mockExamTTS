"content" : "Sometimes it is the simpler product that gives a business a competitive advantage.  Until recently, bicycles had to have many gears, often 15 or 20, for them to be considered high­end.  But fixed­gear bikes with minimal features have become more popular, as those who buy them are happy to pay more for much less.  The overall profitability of these bikes is much higher than the more complex ones because they do a single thing really well without the cost of added complexity.  Companies should be careful of getting into a war over adding more features with their competitors, as this will increase cost and almost certainly reduce profitability because of competitive pressure on price."
