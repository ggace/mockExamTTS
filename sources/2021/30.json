"content" : "Hunting can explain how humans developed reciprocal altruism and social exchange.  Humans seem to be unique among primates in showing extensive reciprocal relationships that can last years, decades, or a lifetime.  Meat from a large game animal comes in quantities that exceed what a single hunter and his immediate family could possibly consume.  Furthermore, hunting success is highly variable; a hunter who is successful one week might fail the next.  These conditions encourage food sharing from hunting.  The costs to a hunter of giving away meat he cannot eat immediately are low because he cannot consume all the meat himself and leftovers will soon spoil.  The benefits can be large, however, when those who are given his food return the generous favor later on when he has failed to get food for himself.  In essence, hunters can store extra meat in the bodies of their friends and neighbors."
