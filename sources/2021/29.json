"content" : "An economic theory of Say’s Law holds that everything that’s made will get sold.  The money from anything that’s produced is used to buy something else.  There can never be a situation in which a firm finds that it can’t sell its goods and so has to dismiss workers and close its factories.  Therefore, recessions and unemployment are impossible.  Picture the level of spending like the level of water in a bath.  Say’s Law applies because people use all their earnings to buy things.  But what happens if people don’t spend all their money, saving some of it instead?  Savings are a ‘leakage’ of spending from the economy.  You’re probably imagining the water level now falling, so there’s less spending in the economy.  That would mean firms producing less and dismissing some of their workers."
