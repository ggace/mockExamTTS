"content" : "In the middle of the night, Matt suddenly awakened.  He glanced at his clock.  It was 3:23.  For just an instant he wondered what had wakened him.  Then he remembered.  He had heard someone come into his room.  Matt sat up in bed, rubbed his eyes, and looked around the small room.  “Mom?” he said quietly, hoping he would hear his mother’s voice assuring him that everything was all right.  But there was no answer. Matt tried to tell himself that he was just hearing things. But he knew he wasn’t.  There was someone in his room. He could hear rhythmic, scratchy breathing and it wasn’t his own.  He lay awake for the rest of the night."
