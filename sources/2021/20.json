"content" : "As you set about to write, it is worth reminding yourself that while you ought to have a point of view, you should avoid telling your readers what to think.  Try to hang a question mark over it all.  This way you allow your readers to think for themselves about the points and arguments you’re making.  As a result, they will feel more involved, finding themselves just as committed to the arguments you’ve made and the insights you’ve exposed as you are.  You will have written an essay that not only avoids passivity in the reader, but is interesting and gets people to think."
