"content" : "The last two decades of research on the science of learning have shown conclusively that we remember things better, and longer, if we discover them ourselves rather than being told them.  This is the teaching method practiced by physics professor Eric Mazur.  He doesn’t lecture in his classes at Harvard.  Instead, he asks students difficult questions, based on their homework reading, that require them to pull together sources of information to solve a problem.  Mazur doesn’t give them the answer; instead, he asks the students to break off into small groups and discuss the problem among themselves.  Eventually, nearly everyone in the class gets the answer right, and the concepts stick with them because they had to find their own way to the answer."
