"content" : "Many evolutionary biologists argue that humans developed language for economic reasons.  We needed to trade, and we needed to establish trust in order to trade.  Language is very handy when you are trying to conduct business with someone. Two early humans could not only agree to trade three wooden bowls for six bunches of bananas but establish rules as well. What wood was used for the bowls?  Where did you get the bananas?  That business deal would have been nearly impossible using only gestures and confusing noises, and carrying it out according to terms agreed upon creates a bond of trust. Language allows us to be specific, and this is where conversation plays a key role."
