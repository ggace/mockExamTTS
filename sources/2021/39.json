"content" : "Rewarding business success doesn’t always have to be done in a material way.  A software company I once worked for had a great way of recognizing sales success.  The sales director kept an air horn outside his office and would come out and blow the horn every time a salesperson settled a deal.  The noise, of course, interrupted anything and everything happening in the office because it was unbelievably loud.  However, it had an amazingly positive impact on everyone.  Sometimes rewarding success can be as easy as that, especially when peer recognition is important.  You should have seen the way the rest of the sales team wanted the air horn blown for them."
