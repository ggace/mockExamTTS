"content" : "Vegetarian eating is moving into the mainstream as more and more young adults say no to meat, poultry, and fish.  According to the American Dietetic Association, “approximately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, are nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.”  But health concerns are not the only reason that young adults give for changing their diets.  Some make the choice out of concern for animal rights.  When faced with the statistics that show the majority of animals raised as food live in confinement, many teens give up meat to protest those conditions.  Others turn to vegetarianism to support the environment.  Meat production uses vast amounts of water, land, grain, and energy and creates problems with animal waste and resulting pollution."
