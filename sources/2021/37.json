"content" : "In a study, a researcher pretending to be a volunteer surveyed a California neighborhood, asking residents if they would allow a large sign reading ‘‘Drive Carefully’’ to be displayed on their front lawns.  To help them understand what it would look like, the volunteer showed his participants a picture of the large sign blocking the view of a beautiful house.  Naturally, most people refused, but in one particular group, an incredible 76 percent actually approved.  The reason that they agreed was this: two weeks earlier, these residents had been asked by another volunteer to make a small commitment to display a tiny sign that read ‘‘Be a Safe Driver’’ in their windows.  Since it was such a small and simple request, nearly all of them agreed.  The astonishing result was that the initial small commitment deeply influenced their willingness to accept the much larger request two weeks later."
