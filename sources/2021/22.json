"content" : "It’s important that you think independently and fight for what you believe in, but there comes a time when it’s wiser to stop fighting for your view and move on to accepting what a trustworthy group of people think is best.  This can be extremely difficult.  But it’s smarter, and ultimately better for you to be open­minded and have faith that the conclusions of a trustworthy group of people are better than whatever you think.  If you can’t understand their view, you’re probably just blind to their way of thinking.  If you continue doing what you think is best when all the evidence and trustworthy people are against you, you’re being dangerously confident.  The truth is that while most people can become incredibly open­minded, some can’t, even after they have repeatedly encountered lots of pain from betting that they were right when they were not."
