"content" : "Understanding how to develop respect for and a knowledge of other cultures begins with reexamining the golden rule: “I treat others in the way I want to be treated.”  This rule makes sense on some level; if we treat others as well as we want to be treated, we will be treated well in return.  This rule works well in a monocultural setting, where everyone is working within the same cultural framework.  In a multicultural setting, however, where words, gestures, beliefs, and views may have different meanings, this rule has an unintended result; it can send a message that my culture is better than yours.  It can also create a frustrating situation where we believe we are doing what is right, but what we are doing is not being interpreted in the way in which it was meant.  This miscommunication can lead to problems."
