"content" : "Diversity, challenge, and conflict help us maintain our imagination.  Most people assume that conflict is bad and that being in one’s “comfort zone” is good.  That is not exactly true.  Of course, we don’t want to find ourselves without a job or medical insurance or in a fight with our partner, family, boss, or coworkers.  One bad experience can be sufficient to last us a lifetime.  But small disagreements with family and friends, trouble with technology or finances, or challenges at work and at home can help us think through our own capabilities.  Problems that need solutions force us to use our brains in order to develop creative answers.  Navigating landscapes that are varied, that offer trials and occasional conflicts, is more helpful to creativity than hanging out in landscapes that pose no challenge to our senses and our minds.  Our two million­year history is packed with challenges and conflicts."
