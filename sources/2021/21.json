"content" : "Nothing is trash by nature.  Anthropologist Mary Douglas brings back and analyzes the common saying that dirt is “matter out of place.”  Dirt is relative, she emphasizes.  “Shoes are not dirty in themselves, but it is dirty to place them on the dining­table; food is not dirty in itself, but it is dirty to leave pots and pans in the bedroom, or food all over clothing; similarly, bathroom items in the living room; clothing lying on chairs; outdoor things placed indoors; upstairs things downstairs, and so on.”  Sorting the dirty from the clean ― removing the shoes from the table, putting the dirty clothing in the washing machine ― involves systematic ordering and classifying.  Eliminating dirt is thus a positive process."
