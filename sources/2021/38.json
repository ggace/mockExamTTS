"content" : "Studies have consistently shown caffeine to be effective when used together with a pain reliever to treat headaches.  The positive correlation between caffeine intake and staying alert throughout the day has also been well established.  As little as 60 mg (the amount typically in one cup of tea) can lead to a faster reaction time.  However, using caffeine to improve alertness and mental performance doesn’t replace getting a good night’s sleep.  One study from 2018 showed that coffee improved reaction times in those with or without poor sleep, but caffeine seemed to increase errors in the group with little sleep.  Additionally, this study showed that even with caffeine, the group with little sleep did not score as well as those with adequate sleep.  It suggests that caffeine does not fully make up for inadequate sleep."
