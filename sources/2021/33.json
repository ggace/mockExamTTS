"content" : "One big difference between science and stage magic is that while magicians hide their mistakes from the audience, in science you make your mistakes in public.  You show them off so that everybody can learn from them.  This way, you get the advantage of everybody else’s experience, and not just your own idiosyncratic path through the space of mistakes.  This, by the way, is another reason why we humans are so much smarter than every other species.  It is not that our brains are bigger or more powerful, or even that we have the ability to reflect on our own past errors, but that we share the benefits that our individual brains have earned from their individual histories of trial and error."
