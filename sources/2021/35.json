"content" : "The Zeigarnik effect is commonly referred to as the tendency of the subconscious mind to remind you of a task that is incomplete until that task is complete.  Bluma Zeigarnik was a Lithuanian psychologist who wrote in the 1920s about the effects of leaving tasks incomplete.  She noticed the effect while watching waiters serve in a restaurant.  The waiters would remember an order, however complicated, until the order was complete, but they would later find it difficult to remember the order.  Zeigarnik did further studies giving both adults and children puzzles to complete then interrupting them during some of the tasks.  The results showed that both adults and children remembered the tasks that hadnâ€™t been completed because of the interruptions better than the ones that had been completed."
