"content" : "Mobility provides a change to the environment for journalists. Newspaper stories, television reports, and even early online reporting (prior to communication technology such as tablets and smartphones) required one central place to which a reporter would submit his or her news story for printing, broadcast, or posting. Now, though, a reporter can shoot video, record audio, and type directly on their smartphones or tablets and post a news story instantly. Journalists do not need to report to a central location where they all contact sources, type, or edit video. A story can be instantaneously written, shot, and made available to the entire world. The news cycle, and thus the job of the journalist, never takes a break. Thus the “24­hour” news cycle that emerged from the rise of cable TV is now a thing of the past. The news “cycle” is really a constant."
