"content" : "Twenty­three percent of people admit to having shared a fake news story on a popular social networking site, either accidentally or on purpose, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey. It’s tempting for me to attribute it to people being willfully ignorant. Yet the news ecosystem has become so overcrowded and complicated that I can understand why navigating it is challenging. When in doubt, we need to cross­check story lines ourselves. The simple act of fact­checking prevents misinformation from shaping our thoughts. We can consult websites such as FactCheck.org to gain a better understanding of what’s true or false, fact or opinion. "
