"content" : "Many of us live our lives without examining why we habitually do what we do and think what we think. Why do we spend so much of each day working? Why do we save up our money? If pressed to answer such questions, we may respond by saying “because that’s what people like us do.” But there is nothing natural, necessary, or inevitable about any of these things; instead, we behave like this because the culture we belong to compels us to. The culture that we inhabit shapes how we think, feel, and act in the most pervasive ways. It is not in spite of our culture that we are who we are, but precisely because of it."
