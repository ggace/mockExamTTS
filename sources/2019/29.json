"content" : "There are many methods for finding answers to the mysteries of the universe, and science is only one of these. However, science is unique. Instead of making guesses, scientists follow a system designed to prove if their ideas are true or false. They constantly reexamine and test their theories and conclusions. Old ideas are replaced when scientists find new information that they cannot explain. Once somebody makes a discovery, others review it carefully before using the information in their own research. This way of building new knowledge on older discoveries ensures that scientists correct their mistakes. Armed with scientific knowledge, people build tools and machines that transform the way we live, making our lives much easier and better."
