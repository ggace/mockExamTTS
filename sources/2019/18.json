"content" : "Dear Community Members\nAs the director of Save­A­Pet Animal Shelter, I appreciate your help and support in looking after our animals. Despite your efforts, it is beyond our facility’s capacity to care for animals with special needs. Without community members who will take these pets into their homes, our shelter can quickly fill up with difficult­to­adopt cases. This limits our ability to bring in and help more pets. Consider adopting a pet with medical or behavioral needs, or even a senior one. Come into our adoption center and meet some of our longer­term residents. It takes an entire community to save animals’ lives ― we cannot do it without you!\nSincerely,\nDr. Sarah Levitz"
