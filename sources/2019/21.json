"content" : "I believe the second decade of this new century is already very different. There are, of course, still millions of people who equate success with money and power ― who are determined to never get off that treadmill despite the cost in terms of their well­being, relationships, and happiness. There are still millions desperately looking for the next promotion, the next million­dollar payday that they believe will satisfy their longing to feel better about themselves, or silence their dissatisfaction. But both in the West and in emerging economies, there are more people every day who recognize that these are all dead ends ― that they are chasing a broken dream. That we cannot find the answer in our current definition of success alone because ― as Gertrude Stein once said of Oakland ― “There is no there there.”"
