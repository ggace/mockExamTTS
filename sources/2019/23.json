"content" : "Social relationships benefit from people giving each other compliments now and again because people like to be liked and like to receive compliments. In that respect, social lies such as making deceptive but flattering comments (“I like your new haircut.”) may benefit mutual relations. Social lies are told for psychological reasons and serve both self­interest and the interest of others. They serve self­interest because liars may gain satisfaction when they notice that their lies please other people, or because they realize that by telling such lies they avoid an awkward situation or discussion. They serve the interest of others because hearing the truth all the time (“You look much older now than you did a few years ago.”) could damage a person’s confidence and self­esteem."
