"content" : "After the technical rehearsal, the theater company will meet with the director, technical managers, and stage manager to review the rehearsal. Usually there will be comments about all the good things about the performance. Individuals should make mental and written notes on the positive comments about their own personal contributions as well as those directed toward the crew and the entire company. Building on positive accomplishments can reduce nervousness. In addition to positive comments, the director and manager will undoubtedly have comments about what still needs work. Sometimes, these negative comments can seem overwhelming and stressful. Time pressures to make these lastÂ­minute changes can be a source of stress. Take each suggestion with good humor and enthusiasm and tackle each task one by one."
