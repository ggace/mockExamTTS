"content" : "Technological development often forces change, and change is uncomfortable. This is one of the main reasons why technology is often resisted and why some perceive it as a threat. It is important to understand our natural hate of being uncomfortable when we consider the impact of technology on our lives. As a matter of fact, most of us prefer the path of least resistance. This tendency means that the true potential of new technologies may remain unrealized because, for many, starting something new is just too much of a struggle. Even our ideas about how new technology can enhance our lives may be limited by this natural desire for comfort."
