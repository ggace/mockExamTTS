"content" : "Attaining the life a person wants is simple. However, most people settle for less than their best because they fail to start the day off right. If a person starts the day with a positive mindset, that person is more likely to have a positive day. Moreover, how a person approaches the day impacts everything else in that personâ€™s life. If a person begins their day in a good mood, they will likely continue to be happy at work and that will often lead to a more productive day in the office. This increased productivity unsurprisingly leads to better work rewards, such as promotions or raises. Consequently, if people want to live the life of their dreams, they need to realize that how they start their day not only impacts that day, but every aspect of their lives."
