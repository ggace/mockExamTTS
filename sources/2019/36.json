"content" : "We always have a lot of bacteria around us, as they live almost everywhere ― in air, soil, in different parts of our bodies, and even in some of the foods we eat. But do not worry. Most bacteria are good for us. Some live in our digestive systems and help us digest our food, and some live in the environment and produce oxygen so that we can breathe and live on Earth. But unfortunately, a few of these wonderful creatures can sometimes make us sick. This is when we need to see a doctor, who may prescribe medicines to control the infection. But what exactly are these medicines and how do they fight with bacteria? These medicines are called “antibiotics,” which means “against the life of bacteria.” Antibiotics either kill bacteria or stop them from growing."
