"content" : "Salva had to raise money for a project to help southern Sudan. It was the first time that Salva spoke in front of an audience. There were more than a hundred people. Salva’s knees were shaking as he walked to the microphone. “H-h-hello,” he said. His hands trembling, he looked out at the audience. Everyone was looking at him. At that moment, he noticed that every face looked interested in what he had to say. People were smiling and seemed friendly. That made him feel a little better, so he spoke into the microphone again. “Hello,” he repeated. He smiled, feeling at ease, and went on. “I am here to talk to you about a project for southern Sudan.”"
