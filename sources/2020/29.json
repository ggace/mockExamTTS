"content" : " Although it is obvious that part of our assessment of food is its visual appearance, it is perhaps surprising how visual input can override taste and smell. People find it very difficult to correctly identify fruit­flavoured drinks if the colour is wrong, for instance an orange drink that is coloured green. Perhaps even more striking is the experience of wine tasters. One study of Bordeaux University students of wine and wine making revealed that they chose tasting notes appropriate for red wines, such as ‘prune and chocolate’, when they were given white wine coloured with a red dye. Experienced New Zealand wine experts were similarly tricked into thinking that the white wine Chardonnay was in fact a red wine, when it had been coloured with a red dye."
