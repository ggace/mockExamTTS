"content" : " Mirrors and other smooth, shiny surfaces reflect light. We see reflections from such surfaces because the rays of light form an image on the retina of our eyes. Such images are always reversed. Look at yourself in a mirror, wink your right eye and your left eye seems to wink back at you. You can use a mirror to send a coded message to a friend. Stand a mirror upright on the table, so that a piece of paper on the table can be clearly seen in the mirror. Now write a message that looks right when you look in the mirror. Keep your eyes on the reflected image while you are writing and not on your paper. After a little practice, it will be easier to write “backwards.” When your friend receives such a message he will be able to read it by holding the paper up to a mirror.  "
