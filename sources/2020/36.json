"content" : " We make decisions based on what we think we know. It wasn’t too long ago that the majority of people believed the world was flat. This perceived truth impacted behavior. During this period, there was very little exploration. People feared that if they traveled too far they might fall off the edge of the earth. So for the most part they didn’t dare to travel. It wasn’t until that minor detail was revealed ─ the world is round ─ that behaviors changed on a massive scale. Upon this discovery, societies began to travel across the planet. Trade routes were established; spices were traded. New ideas, like mathematics, were shared between societies which allowed for all kinds of innovations and advancements. The correction of a simple false assumption moved the human race forward."
