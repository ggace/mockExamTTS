"content" : " In Dutch bicycle culture, it is common to have a passenger on the backseat. So as to follow the rider’s movements, the person on the backseat needs to hold on tightly. Bicycles turn not just by steering but also by leaning, so the passenger needs to lean the same way as the rider. A passenger who would keep sitting up straight would literally be a pain in the behind. On motorcycles, this is even more critical. Their higher speed requires more leaning on turns, and lack of coordination can be disastrous. The passenger is a true partner in the ride, expected to mirror the rider’s every move."
