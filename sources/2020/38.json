"content" : " Reciprocity can be explored in captivity by handing one chimpanzee a large amount of food, such as a watermelon or leafy branch, and then observing what follows. The owner will be center stage, with a group of others around him or her, soon to be followed by newly formed groups around those who obtained a sizable share, until all food has been distributed. Beggars may complain and cry, but aggressive conflicts are rare. The few times that they do occur, it is the possessor who tries to make someone leave the circle. She will hit them over their head with her branch or bark at them in a highÂ­pitched voice until they leave her alone. Whatever their rank, possessors control the food flow. Once chimpanzees enter reciprocity mode, their social rank no longer matters."
