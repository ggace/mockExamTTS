"content" : " Gender research shows a complex relationship between gender and conflict styles. Some research suggests that women from Western cultures tend to be more caring than men. This tendency may result from socialization processes in which women are encouraged to care for their families and men are encouraged to be successful in competitive work environments. However, we live in a society where gender roles and boundaries are not as strict as in prior generations. There is significant variability in assertiveness and cooperation among women, as well as among men. Although conflict resolution experts should be able to recognize cultural and gender differences, they should also be aware of withinÂ­group variations and the risks of stereotyping. Culture and gender may affect the way people perceive, interpret, and respond to conflict; however, we must be careful to avoid overgeneralizations and to consider individual differences. "
