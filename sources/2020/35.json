And the sun will keep shining on our planet for billions of years. Our challenge isn’t that we’re running out of energy. It’s that we have been focused on the wrong source ―the small, finite one that we’re using up. Indeed, all the coal, natural gas, and oil we use today is just solar energy from millions of years ago, a very tiny part of which was preserved deep underground. Our challenge, and our opportunity, is to learn to efficiently and cheaply use the much more abundant source that is the new energy striking our planet each day from the sun. "
