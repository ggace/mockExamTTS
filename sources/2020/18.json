"content" : "Dear Wildwood residents,\nWildwood Academy is a local school that seeks to help children with disabilities and learning challenges. We currently have over 200 students enrolled. This year weâ€™d like to add a music class in the hope that each of our students will have the opportunity to develop their musical abilities. To get the class started, we need more instruments than we have now. We are asking you to look around your house and donate any instruments that you may no longer use. Each one donated will be assigned to a student in need. Simply call us and we will be happy to drop by and pick up the instrument.\nSincerely,\nKaren Hansen, Principal"
