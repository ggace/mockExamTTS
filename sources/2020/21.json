"content" : "There are more than 700 million cell phones used in the US today and at least 140 million of those cell phone users will abandon their current phone for a new phone every 14-18 months. I’m not one of those people who just “must” have the latest phone. Actually, I use my cell phone until the battery no longer holds a good charge. At that point, it’s time. So I figure I’ll just get a replacement battery. But I’m told that battery is no longer made and the phone is no longer manufactured because there’s newer technology and better features in the latest phones. That’s a typical justification. The phone wasn’t even that old; maybe a little over one year? I’m just one example. Can you imagine how many countless other people have that same scenario? No wonder cell phones take the lead when it comes to “e­waste.” "
